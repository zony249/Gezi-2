# Gezi 2 Development Suite

**NOTE: README IS STILL NOT FINISHED, AND LINKS MAY NOT WORK**

## Overview

Gezi 2 is a new version of the Gezi image classifier that is focused on performance, flexibility, and efficiency. This development suite consists of two programs used to generate training data, as well as train the YOLOv3 classifier. 

#### Training Data Generator

The Training Data Generator is used to create training images as well as generate labels, which would later be fed into the training program. New additions in version 2 are multithreading, which dramatically increases performance, as well as the addition of multiple markers, rotated and scaled markers, etc. More information about Training Data Generator could be found in the [README](./Training-data-generator/README.md) in the program's directory.

#### Yolo Training and Testing

Yolo Training and Testing uses the YOLOv3 training program written by **Ultralytics LLC**, so a huge thank-you goes to them for making this program open source! This network is trained on custom data generated by the Training Data Generator. This is a very different network compared to the original Gezi NN, which used 3 convolutional layers and two FC layers (this uses over 100 convolutional layers!) The goal of this network is to enable multi-object detection and classification. More information about Yolo Training and Testing can be found in [README](./Yolo-training-testing/README.md) in the program's directory.
